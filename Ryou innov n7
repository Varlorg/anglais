In France, there is four main network operator. 
Those operator are all private company that use 
the France Telecom network wich is a french public company.
The four main operator are Bouygues, Free Mobile, Orange and SFR.
They enters into a business agreement with mobile virtual network
operator (MVNO)
(or mobile other licensed operator (MOLO) in the United Kingdom)
to give away bulk access to their network.

In order to cover the whole french territory, BTS come installed
with an average of three antennas. Each antenna can manage 500
frequency channels. That mean each BTS can manage 1500 frequency channel
and can reach 35km. With only 3 frequency to communicate, BTS have no
interference between their three antennas and between them and their
congener as you can see on the figure below.

However, those differents frequency channel prevent user's mobile
phone from moving from a BTS area to another. That's the reason we
invented the hand-over. It is an event that occur when the mobile
station change area. The mobile prepare itself and switch frequency
depending mainly on the quality of the transmission. The BTS can also
ask for a hand over if he is overcrowded.
